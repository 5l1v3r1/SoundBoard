Project Name: Audio Mashup

Description: An android application intending to mix music live on a users device using a very simple interface
with primarily a few play boards and some buttons. The application can play just about any form of audio, but currently 
is only able to mix WAV and MP3 Files.

Some sub functions include voice recording and audio clipping. Currently the audio clipping is also restricted to MP3 files only.

Libraries required include:
bugsense-trace-1-1-2
jl1.0.1 (Jlayer - MP3 decoder)

These can be found online with a simple google search.

TO-DO:

Improve interface (currently looks somewhat sloppy)
Improve music search function

Bug: MP3 splitter seems to be clipping a few milliseconds when using very precise clipping criteria. ex 2m:01s:950ms
Bug: Some users claim to be unable to find clipped files in their Custom Soundclip folders
